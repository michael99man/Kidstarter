								<p>Kidstarter's unique model answers the biggest question donors have when donating: "Where does my money go?" Through our wish-based donation system, know exactly who your support is going to and how it's going to make a difference in his or her life. 
                                
                                </p>

								<p>Presently, Kidstarter focuses mainly on helping young children in China escape the poverty they were born into. Despite China's rapid economic growth, many Chinese families still have very limited social welfare due to the vastness of China's population. In a system plagued by corruption and injustice, the only path out of poverty for tens of millions of Chinese kids is education.</p>
                                
                                <p>
                                However, many kids born into poverty do not have what they need to obtain a quality education. This is where Kidstarter comes in. With your support, we can provide for these kids some basic materials to further their education. Together, we can make kickstart these kids on the path to a brighter future.
